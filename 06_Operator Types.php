4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator. PHP language supports following type 
of operators.";

Assignment Operators<br>
Conditional (or ternary) Operator";

echo"The following arithmetic operators are supported by PHP language:
Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then:";

echo"<h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1>
Operator Description Example
<br>+ - Adds two operands - A + B will give 30
<br>- - Subtracts second operand from the first - A - B will give -10
<br>* - Multiply both operands - A * B will give 200
<br>/ - Divide the numerator by denominator - B / A will give 2
<br>% - Modulus Operator and remainder of after an  integer division - B % A will give 0
++ - Increment operator, increases integer value by one - A++ will give 11
-- - Decrement operator, decreases integer value by one - A-- will give 9
